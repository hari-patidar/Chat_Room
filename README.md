# Chat_Room

* Description: A basic chat room application developed in Python. This is the minor project which is basically a client and server based chat room which can handle multiple users.
Also the chats shared in this chat room are enccrypted with a manually created encryption algorithm by me and my project partners. User can also share there files and folders through the server and chat here without any security issues. The server side must be setup differently and the client side must be different. The complete code is created in python only using different modules and packages and currently we are working on it to make it more efficient and user friendly. Once everything seems to be okay we will be adding the executable file for client side and server sides seperately.

* Features:
        1. Supports multiple users connecting to a common chat server.
        2. Facilitates real-time text communication among users.

* Usage Instructions:
        1. Run the server script to start the chat server.
        2. Users can connect using the client script to join the chat room.

* Dependencies: Requires Python's socket and threading modules.
